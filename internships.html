                <p>During the Logitech-sponsored Girls Who Code Internship, I was able to hone my programming skills and even learn a new JavaScript library called p5.js. Throughout the two-week internship, I not only gained new knowledge and connected with my fellow participants, but also created a functional game that I presented to Logitech. While the game isn't flawless, I am continuing to improve its interface and functionality.</p>

            <img src="images/assets/wit.png" alt="logo" width="300" height="240">
            <p>I have been involved in the Women in Tech Internships Program at the Paradise Valley School District for the last three
            years. During this time, we have explored various topics ranging from Sustainable Growth Development Goals to
            Cybersquerty. This summer, our focus was on AI, particularly with the emergence of large language models such as GPT and
            BARD AI. We delved into AI models and gained hands-on experience working with cloud-based systems like Microsoft AZURE.</p>
            
            <h4 class="section-header"> ASU Fleischer Scholars Summer Program</h4>
            <img src="images/assets/fleischer_logo.png" alt="logo" width="300" height="180">
            <p>During my participation in the ASU Fleischer Scholar Summer Program, I gained valuable insights on the significance of
            time management and efficient communication. The program equips students with a mental framework, represented by a
            3-legged stool constructed using these three essential tools, to excel and become adept at adapting to new challenges.
            Through this experience, I acquired skills in Business Strategy, Business Analysis, Business Planning, and Microsoft
            Excel.</p>
