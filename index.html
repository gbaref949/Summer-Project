            <p>Explore my summer internships, where I had the privilege to immerse myself in a dynamic and hands-on learning
            environment. Collaborating with industry professionals, I contributed to real-world projects, honed my skills in
            computer skills and explored subject areas like machine learning and AI in education, and gained invaluable insights
            into the technology world from professionals at notable companies like Logitech, ASU, and the Paradise Valley School
            District. These internships not only deepened my understanding of technology and the role it plays on the world, but
            also provided me with a solid foundation for future endeavors. Explore the highlights, challenges, and growth I
            experienced during this transformative summer internship.</p>
